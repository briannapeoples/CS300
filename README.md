In this course, I worked on projects that required solving real problems using programming. The main challenge was figuring out how to organize data and build efficient solutions. Choosing the right data structures was important because they help store and process information in a way that makes programs run faster and use less memory.

To tackle these problems, I started by breaking them into smaller parts and thinking about the best way to store and access data. For example, I used arrays, linked lists, and hash maps depending on what was needed. When I hit roadblocks, like errors in my code or unexpected behavior, I debugged step by step, looked up examples, and sometimes asked for help or reread the instructions.

Working on this project helped me think more about software design and how to write better programs. I now see the importance of writing clean, organized, and reusable code instead of just making something work once. I also focus more on naming variables clearly, adding comments, and following a structure that makes it easy to update or fix later.

Overall, this project taught me how to write better, more maintainable programs that others (or even my future self) can understand and improve. It also showed me that planning and choosing the right approach makes solving problems much easier.
